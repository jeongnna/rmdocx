# Description

Given a set of observations $(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n)$, where each observation is a *d*-dimensional real vector, k-means clustering aims to partition the *n* observations into $k(\leq n)$ sets $S = \{S_1, S_2, \cdots, S_k\}$ so as to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) (i.e. variance). Formally, the objective is to find:

$$
\underset{S}{\arg \min} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in S_i} ||x - \mu_i||^2 = \underset{S}{\arg \min} \sum_{i=1}^{k} |S_i| Var S_i
$$
